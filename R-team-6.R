#Install all the relevant packages to be used in R Analysis in later part of the code

library("car")




#2.Import the data
#Importing the library readxl which helps in excel import

library(readxl)
#Importing excel data using the read_excel function from readxl package 

#Set the directory for the Raw file

#3.Understand the data

#Importing tidyverse library which is used to perform different data analysis such as to use glimpse function
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(FB_DATA)

#attaching the dataset, so that we don't have to call the dataset name, and can use the variables directly

#4.Definition of the columns

#1) ad_id: unique ID for each ad
#2) xyz_campaign_id: an ID associated with each ad campaign of Goyano
#3) fb_campaign_id: an ID associated with how Facebook tracks each campaign
#4) age: age of the person to whom the ad is shown
#5) gender: gender of the person to whom the add is shown
#6) interest: a code specifying the category to which the personâ€™s interest belongs
#7) Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown
#8) Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad
#9) Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that ad
#10) Total conversion: Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad
#11) Approved conversion: Total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad

#9.Linear Hypothesis
#9.1. Linear Hypothesis  on Total Conversions
#Importing car library
library("car")

#Performing linear hypothesis to see whether increasing the amount spent increases the effect of gender (Male/Female) on Total Conversion
linearHypothesis(ml1,"as.factor(gender)M:Spent")




#9.2. Linear Hypothesis  on Approved Conversions
#Importing car library

#Performing linear hypothesis to see whether increasing the amount spent increases the effect of gender (Male/Female) on Approved Conversion
linearHypothesis(ml2,"as.factor(gender)M:Spent")
